			Atherosclerosis which is the major factor in causing Coronary artery Disease is the gradual accumulation of plaque within an artery forming an artherosclerotic lesion (artheroma), it begins with formation of fatty, fibrous plaque on the intima of coronary arteries.
 
			 First the Plaque is formed when the endothelium is injured by low density lipoproteins (LDL)products of cigarette smoke, hypertension, hyperglycemia, infection, increased homocysteine, hyperfibrinogenemia, and lipoprotein. The injury triggers an inflammatory response , which makes  the endothelium sticky and thereby attracting other adhesion molecules.Plaque consists of lipid  filled macrophages (foam cells), fibrin, cellular waste products, and plasma proteins, covered by a fibrous outer layer (smooth muscle cells and dense connective tissue).

					<p>Peripheral vascular diseases  are circulation disorders that affect blood vessels outside of the heart and brain.It  strikes the veins and arteries that supply the arms, legs, and organs located below your stomach. These are the blood vessels that are distant from the heart. They are known as peripheral vessels.
					In peripheral vascular disease, blood vessels are narrowed. Narrowing is  caused by arteriosclerosis which is a condition where plaque builds up inside a vessel. It is also called “hardening of the arteries.” Plaque decreases the amount of blood and oxygen supplied to the arms and legs.

						<p>In an ischemic brain attack, there is disruption of the cerebral  blood flow due to obstruction of a blood vessel. This disruption in blood flow initiates a complex series of cellular metabolic events referred to as the ischemic cascade.The ischemic cascade begins when cerebral blood flow falls to less than 25 mL/100 g/min. At this point, neurons can no longer maintain aerobic respiration. The mitochondria must then switch to anaerobic respiration, which generates large amounts of lactic acid, causing a change in the pH level.  </p>
